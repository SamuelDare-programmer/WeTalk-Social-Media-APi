Frontend (Client-Side)
Framework: React 19 with Vite for lightning-fast development and build performance.
Styling: Tailwind CSS for a completely custom, responsive design system.
Animations: Framer Motion for fluid micro-interactions and page transitions.

Icons: Lucide React for a clean, consistent iconography set.
Routing: React Router DOM v7 for seamless client-side navigation.
Backend (Server-Side)
API Framework: FastAPI (Python) offering high performance and automatic OpenAPI documentation.
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL) accessed via Beanie ODM for flexible data modeling.
Task Queue: Celery with Redis for handling background jobs (e.g., video processing, cleanup tasks).
Media Storage: Cloudinary for optimized image and video hosting/streaming.
Real-time Communication: WebSocket integration for instant messaging feature support.
Deployment & Infrastructure
Hybrid Cloud Strategy:
Vercel for the frontend application and API producer.

🎨 User Experience (UX) Design
The WeTalk interface is built on three core design pillars:

Premium Aesthetics: Moving away from generic flat designs, WeTalk employs glassmorphism, subtle gradients, and a refined color palette to create a high-end feel.
Responsiveness: A mobile-first approach ensures the application looks and performs perfectly on devices of all sizes, from large desktops to smartphones.
Dynamic Interactivity: Every interaction provides feedback. Buttons react to clicks, pages transition smoothly, and loading states are handled gracefully, making the app feel "alive" and responsive.
